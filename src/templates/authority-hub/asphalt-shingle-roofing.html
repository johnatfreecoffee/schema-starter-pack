            <h2>Types of Asphalt Shingles We Install</h2>
            
            <h3>Three-Tab Shingles</h3>
            <p>The most economical option, three-tab shingles provide a clean, uniform appearance. They're lightweight, easy to install, and perfect for budget-conscious homeowners who don't want to compromise on quality.</p>
            
            <h3>Architectural (Dimensional) Shingles</h3>
            <p>Our most popular choice, architectural shingles offer enhanced durability and a more sophisticated appearance with dimensional depth. They typically last 25-30 years and provide better wind and impact resistance than three-tab options.</p>
            
            <h3>Luxury (Designer) Shingles</h3>
            <p>For homeowners seeking premium aesthetics, luxury shingles replicate the look of slate, cedar shake, or tile roofing at a fraction of the cost. These high-performance shingles come with extended warranties and exceptional weather protection.</p>
            
            <h3>Impact-Resistant Shingles</h3>
            <p>Specially designed for areas prone to hail and severe weather, impact-resistant shingles can significantly reduce damage and may qualify you for insurance discounts.</p>

            <h3>How long do asphalt shingle roofs last?</h3>
            <p>Quality asphalt shingle roofs typically last 20-30 years, depending on the shingle type, climate, ventilation, and maintenance. Architectural shingles generally outlast three-tab shingles by 5-10 years.</p>

            <h3>Can you install new shingles over old ones?</h3>
