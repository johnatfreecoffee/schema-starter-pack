# 🧪 STAGE 2: COPYWRITING

🤖 **AUTOMATION MODE:** Write ALL copy in ONE response.

---

## TRANSACTIONAL COPY FOUNDATION

**Before writing ANY copy, understand:** We target customers ready to take action NOW, not browsers seeking information. Every word moves them toward calling or booking.

**Transactional Intent Signals to Weave Throughout:**

- Immediate need language: "today," "now," "fast," "emergency," "same-day"
- Action-ready phrases: "schedule your," "get started," "book your," "request your"
- Problem-solution framing: Lead with pain point, immediately offer solution
- Location + Service combinations: "{{service_name}} in {{city_name}}" throughout
- Decision-stage language: "ready to," "it's time to," "don't wait," "before it gets worse"

---

## TASK: Write complete copy for every wireframe section. Provide:

### 1. HEADLINES

**H1: Compelling, Keyword-Rich, Transactional (NO emoji at start)**

- Format: [Service] + [Location] + [Action/Benefit]
- Examples:
  - "Emergency Roof Repair in {{city_name}} – Call Now for Same-Day Service"
  - "{{city_name}} Roofing Contractors Ready to Start Your Project Today"
  - "Need Storm Damage Repair in {{city_name}}? Get Your Free Inspection"
- ❌ AVOID broad/informational: "About Residential Roofing"
- ✅ USE transactional: "Hire {{city_name}}'s Trusted Roofing Contractors Today"

**H2s: Section Titles (emoji OK at end: "Our Services ✨")**

- Include service specificity and urgency where appropriate
- Examples: "Fast Storm Damage Restoration 🌪️" / "Insurance Claims Made Easy ✅"

**H3s: Subheadings as Needed**

- Support transactional flow
- Include micro-conversions: "Here's What Happens When You Call"

---

### 2. BODY COPY

**Transactional Copy Structure (Use This Pattern):**

```
[Problem/Need] + [Solution] + [Why Us] + [Action]

Example: "Dealing with a leaking roof? {{business_name}} provides fast, reliable
roof repair with decades of local experience. Our licensed team responds within
24 hours. Call now for your free inspection."
```

**Opening Sentence Rules:**

- First sentence: Acknowledge their problem/need immediately
- Second sentence: Position {{business_name}} as the solution
- Third sentence: Provide proof (experience, credentials)
- Final sentence: Clear next step/CTA

**Urgency Triggers to Include:**

- "Before minor damage becomes major repairs"
- "Don't let water damage spread"
- "Limited availability during storm season"
- "Insurance claim deadlines approaching"
- "Protect your investment today"

**Location Saturation:**

- Mention {{city_name}} naturally 3-5x per major section
- Reference "your {{city_name}} neighbors trust us"
- Include surrounding service areas when relevant

**Additional Requirements:**

- Complete paragraphs for each content block
- Match brand voice from context
- 2-4 emojis per section (NOT in buttons)
- Use {{business_name}} for all company references

---

### 3. CALLS-TO-ACTION

**Button Text (NO emojis in buttons)**

**Primary CTAs (High-Intent):**

- "Call Now"
- "Get Free Quote"
- "Schedule Today"
- "Request Emergency Service"

**Secondary CTAs:**

- "Schedule Service"
- "Learn More"
- "See Our Work"
- "Check Coverage"

**Urgency CTAs (Emergency/Storm Pages):**

- "Get Help Now"
- "24/7 Emergency Line"
- "Same-Day Response"

**CTA Placement Guidelines:**

- Above the fold: Primary phone/quote CTA
- After problem section: Schedule/Quote CTA
- After trust section: Secondary CTA
- Consider sticky mobile CTA

---

### 4. NAVIGATION & UI TEXT

- Menu labels (clear, action-oriented)
- Form field labels (simple, low-friction)
- Breadcrumb text incorporating {{city_name}} and {{service_name}}
- Footer navigation labels

---

### 5. META CONTENT

**Page Title Formats (Transactional):**

- Standard: `[Keyword] | {{business_name}}`
- Enhanced: `{{service_name}} {{city_name}} | {{business_name}}`
- Emergency: `Emergency {{service_name}} {{city_name}} | {{business_name}}`

**Meta Description (150-160 characters):**

- Pattern: `[Service] in [City]. [Proof point]. [CTA]. Call for free quote.`
- Include: Service + City + Differentiator + Call to Action
- Example: `Expert roof repair in {{city_name}}. Licensed, insured, fast response. Call {{business_name}} today for your free inspection.`
