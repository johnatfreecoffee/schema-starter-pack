# STAGE 1: WIREFRAME & CONTENT PLANNING

🤖 AUTOMATION MODE: Complete entire wireframe in ONE response.

TASK: Create a detailed wireframe and content structure. Output must include:

1. PAGE LAYOUT STRUCTURE
   - Hero section with image placement
   - Main content sections (minimum 3)
   - CTA placements

2. CONTENT BLOCKS
   - Name and purpose of each block
   - IMAGE PLACEHOLDERS: Identify hero, service, team, process images
   - Special features (accordions, grids, etc.)

3. INFORMATION HIERARCHY
   - Primary message → Secondary messages → Supporting details

4. CALL-TO-ACTION STRATEGY
   - Primary CTA: Phone button with {{phone}}
   - Secondary CTAs: Form triggers using window.openLeadFormModal()

5. NAVIGATION STRUCTURE (reference only - system injects header/footer)

FORMAT: Structured wireframe document with clear section labels.

CRITICAL RULES:

- NO headers/footers (system injects these)
- All business data will use Handlebars variables ({{business_name}}, {{phone}}, etc.)
- Identify 3-6 image placements with descriptive purposes
- Complete ALL 5 sections - no partial outputs
