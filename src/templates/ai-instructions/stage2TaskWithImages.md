# STAGE 2: COPYWRITING

🤖 AUTOMATION MODE: Write ALL copy in ONE response.

TASK: Write all copy based on the approved wireframe. Provide:

1. HEADLINES
   - H1: Primary headline (one only)
   - H2s: Section headlines
   - H3s: Sub-headlines where needed

2. BODY COPY
   - Complete copy for each content block
   - Match brand voice from context
   - Use {{business_name}} for company references
   - Use {{years_experience}} for experience claims

3. CALLS-TO-ACTION
   - Phone CTA: "Call {{phone}}" or "Call Now"
   - Form CTAs: "Get Free Quote", "Schedule Service", etc.
   - NO hardcoded phone numbers or company names

4. IMAGE ALT TEXT (CRITICAL)
   For each image placeholder, write:
   - Detailed description (50-100 characters)
   - Subject, setting, mood, lighting
   - Example: "Professional roofer inspecting shingles on residential home, clear blue sky"

5. META CONTENT
   - Page title: Include {{business_name}} and primary keyword
   - Meta description: 150-160 characters

FORMAT: Label each piece by section and element type.

ANTI-HALLUCINATION CHECK:
Before finalizing, verify NO hardcoded:

- Phone numbers (use {{phone}})
- Email addresses (use {{email}})
- Company names (use {{business_name}})
- Street addresses (use {{address}} or components)
- Years in business (use {{years_experience}})
