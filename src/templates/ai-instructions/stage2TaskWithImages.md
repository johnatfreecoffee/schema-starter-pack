# 🧪🗺️ STAGE 2: COPYWRITING

🤖 **AUTOMATION MODE:** Write ALL copy in ONE response.

---

## TRANSACTIONAL COPY FOUNDATION

**Before writing ANY copy, understand:** We target customers ready to take action NOW, not browsers seeking information. Every word moves them toward calling or booking.

**Transactional Intent Signals to Weave Throughout:**

- Immediate need language: "today," "now," "fast," "emergency," "same-day"
- Action-ready phrases: "schedule your," "get started," "book your," "request your"
- Problem-solution framing: Lead with pain point, immediately offer solution
- Location + Service combinations: "{{service_name}} in {{city_name}}" throughout
- Decision-stage language: "ready to," "it's time to," "don't wait," "before it gets worse"

**Why Transactional Copy Matters:**

- Broad keywords like "residential roofing" attract browsers
- Specific phrases like "emergency roof repair {{city_name}}" attract buyers
- Every page should answer: "Why should I call {{business_name}} RIGHT NOW?"

---

## TASK: Write all copy based on the approved wireframe. Provide:

### 1. HEADLINES

**H1: Primary Headline (One Only) - Transactional & Keyword-Rich**

- Format: [Service] + [Location] + [Action/Benefit]
- Examples:
  - "Emergency Roof Repair in {{city_name}} – Call Now for Same-Day Service"
  - "{{city_name}} Roofing Contractors Ready to Start Your Project Today"
  - "Need {{service_name}} in {{city_name}}? Schedule Your Free Inspection"
  - "Trusted {{service_name}} Serving {{city_name}} for {{years_experience}}+ Years"
- ❌ AVOID broad/informational: "About Our Roofing Services"
- ✅ USE transactional: "Hire {{city_name}}'s Most Trusted Roofing Team Today"

**H2s: Section Headlines**

- Include service specificity and urgency where appropriate
- Tie to customer's decision journey
- Examples:
  - "Why {{city_name}} Homeowners Choose {{business_name}}"
  - "Fast, Reliable {{service_name}} When You Need It Most"
  - "Get Your Free {{city_name}} Roof Inspection"

**H3s: Sub-Headlines Where Needed**

- Support transactional flow
- Include micro-conversions: "Here's What Happens When You Call"
- Guide reader through decision process

---

### 2. BODY COPY

**Transactional Copy Structure (Use This Pattern):**

```
[Problem/Need] + [Solution] + [Why Us] + [Action]

Example: "Dealing with storm damage in {{city_name}}? {{business_name}} provides
fast, reliable restoration with {{years_experience}}+ years of local experience.
Our licensed team responds within 24 hours. Call {{phone}} for your free inspection."
```

**Opening Sentence Rules:**

- First sentence: Acknowledge their problem/need immediately
- Second sentence: Position {{business_name}} as the solution
- Third sentence: Provide proof ({{years_experience}}, credentials)
- Final sentence: Clear next step/CTA

**Urgency Triggers to Include:**

- "Before minor damage becomes major repairs"
- "Don't let water damage spread to your home's interior"
- "Limited availability during storm season"
- "Insurance claim deadlines approaching"
- "Protect your investment today"
- "Weather won't wait – neither should you"

**Location Saturation Requirements:**

- Mention {{city_name}} naturally 3-5x per major section
- Use {{service_name}} + {{city_name}} combinations
- Reference: "Your {{city_name}} neighbors trust us"
- Include surrounding service areas when relevant
- Add local landmarks or area references where natural

**Additional Requirements:**

- Complete copy for each content block
- Match brand voice from context
- Use {{business_name}} for ALL company references
- Use {{years_experience}} for ALL experience claims
- Never fabricate statistics or claims

---

### 3. CALLS-TO-ACTION

**Phone CTA:**

- "Call {{phone}}"
- "Call Now"
- "Call {{phone}} Today"
- "Speak With an Expert: {{phone}}"

**Form CTAs:**

- "Get Free Quote"
- "Schedule Service"
- "Request Inspection"
- "Book Your Appointment"
- "Get Started Today"

**Urgency CTAs (Emergency/Storm Pages):**

- "Get Emergency Help Now"
- "24/7 Response: {{phone}}"
- "Same-Day Service Available"

**NO hardcoded phone numbers or company names in CTAs**

**CTA Placement Guidelines:**

- Above the fold: Primary phone/quote CTA
- After each major section: Relevant CTA
- After problem description: Solution CTA
- After trust/proof section: Conversion CTA
- Floating/sticky on mobile: Phone CTA

---

### 4. IMAGE ALT TEXT (CRITICAL)

For each image placeholder, write:

- Detailed description (50-100 characters)
- Subject, setting, mood, lighting
- Include {{city_name}} or location context when relevant
- Support SEO with descriptive, keyword-aware text

**Alt Text Examples:**

```
Hero Image:
"Professional roofer inspecting shingles on {{city_name}} residential home, clear blue sky"

Service Image:
"{{business_name}} crew installing metal roofing on suburban home, safety equipment visible"

Storm Damage:
"Storm damage restoration in progress on {{city_name}} property after hurricane"

Team Photo:
"Licensed {{business_name}} roofing contractors standing beside company truck"

Before/After:
"Completed roof replacement showing new architectural shingles on {{city_name}} home"

Insurance Process:
"Homeowner reviewing insurance paperwork with {{business_name}} claims specialist"
```

**Alt Text Formula:**
`[Subject] + [Action/State] + [Location/Setting] + [Mood/Condition]`

---

### 5. META CONTENT

**Page Title Formats (Transactional):**

- Standard: `{{service_name}} {{city_name}} | {{business_name}}`
- With Phone: `{{service_name}} {{city_name}} | Call {{phone}} | {{business_name}}`
- Emergency: `Emergency {{service_name}} {{city_name}} – 24/7 | {{business_name}}`
- Location Focus: `{{city_name}} {{service_category}} Contractors | {{business_name}}`

**Meta Description (150-160 characters):**

- Pattern: `[Service] in [City]. [Proof point]. [CTA]. Call for free quote.`
- Must include: Service + City + Differentiator + Call to Action

**Meta Description Examples:**

```
Standard Service:
"Expert {{service_name}} in {{city_name}}. {{years_experience}}+ years experience,
licensed & insured. Call {{business_name}} for your free inspection today."

Emergency Service:
"24/7 emergency {{service_name}} in {{city_name}}. Fast response, insurance claim
experts. Call now for same-day service from {{business_name}}."

Insurance Claims:
