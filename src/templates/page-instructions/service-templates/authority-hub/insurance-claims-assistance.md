A: Timeline varies by damage complexity and insurance company, but most claims resolve within 30-60 days with professional advocacy. Emergency repairs can often begin immediately with advance payments.

A: Yes, we have experience with all major insurance providers including State Farm, Allstate, USAA, Farmers, Progressive, and local carriers. Each company has different processes we navigate expertly.

**Q: What documentation do I need to provide?**
