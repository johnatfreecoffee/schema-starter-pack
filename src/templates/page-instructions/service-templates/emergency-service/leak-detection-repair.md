## EMERGENCY LEAK FAQ SECTION

### Layout Specification
- **Component**: Accordion-style FAQ
- **Background**: Light gray (#F7FAFC)
- **Max Width**: 900px centered
- **Padding**: 80px top/bottom

### Section Headline (H2)
**Text**: "Emergency Leak Questions Answered"

### FAQ Items (Expandable)

**Q: How quickly can you respond to an emergency leak in {{city_name}}?**
A: For active leaks causing immediate damage, we dispatch emergency crews within 2 hours during business hours. For after-hours emergencies, we maintain 24/7 on-call service with typical response within 3-4 hours. Call {{company_phone}} to reach our emergency dispatch.

**Q: What should I do immediately when I discover a roof leak?**
A: 
1. Place buckets/containers to catch water
2. Move furniture and valuables away from leak
3. Turn off electricity in affected areas if water is near outlets
4. Document damage with photos for insurance
5. Call us immediately at {{company_phone}}
6. DO NOT go on the roof yourself - dangerous and may void insurance

**Q: How much does leak detection cost?**
A: Basic leak detection inspections start at $199. This includes visual assessment and moisture scanning. Advanced thermal imaging adds $150-300. However, if we complete the repair work, the inspection fee is typically waived. Emergency after-hours service includes a $150 dispatch fee.

**Q: Will my insurance cover leak detection and repair?**
A: Coverage depends on the leak cause. Sudden, accidental leaks (storm damage, tree impact) are typically covered. Gradual leaks from lack of maintenance usually aren't covered. We document everything to maximize your claim success. Our team will review your policy and help determine coverage.

**Q: How do you find leaks when I can't see where water is entering?**
A: Water travels through insulation, along roof decking, and down walls before appearing as stains. We use:
- Thermal imaging to detect temperature differences
- Moisture meters to track water paths
- Dye testing for intermittent leaks
- Experience identifying failure patterns
This technology finds the actual entry point, not just where water appears.

**Q: Can you repair a leak the same day you find it?**
A: For emergency situations, yes. We carry common repair materials (shingles, flashing, sealants) on our trucks for immediate fixes. Complex repairs requiring special materials or extensive work are scheduled as quickly as possible. Emergency tarping and temporary sealing always available same-day.

**Q: What if the leak is in a hard-to-reach location?**
A: We have equipment and training for all access situations:
- Steep-slope safety gear and scaffolding
- Aerial lifts for tall buildings
- Specialized tools for tight spaces
- Confined space entry certification
No leak is too difficult to reach safely and repair properly.

**Q: How do I know if water damage is from a current leak or an old one?**
A: Our moisture meters and thermal imaging distinguish between:
- Active leaks (elevated moisture levels, temperature patterns)
- Recent leaks (damp but drying materials)
- Old damage (dry stains, no active moisture)
This helps determine repair urgency and insurance claim viability.

## COMPETITOR DIFFERENTIATION

"Most contractors fix leaks but leave you to battle insurance alone. We document everything with professional photos and reports that insurance adjusters accept. Our claim approval rate: 98%."

**Emergency Response**:
"24/7 emergency service isn't just an answering service. Real technicians, real trucks, real equipment responding to your {{city_name}} property in under 2 hours."

**Permanent Solutions**:
"We don't just patch leaks - we fix the underlying problems. Every repair includes addressing the root cause so the leak doesn't return in 6 months."
