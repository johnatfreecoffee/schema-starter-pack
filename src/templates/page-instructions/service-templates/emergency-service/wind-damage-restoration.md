## FAQ SECTION (Wind Damage Specific)

### Component Type
Accordion-style expandable Q&A

### Section Header
**H2**: "Wind Damage FAQs for {{city_name}} Property Owners"

### FAQ Items (8 questions)

**Q1: How quickly can you respond to wind damage emergencies in {{city_name}}?**
```
We maintain 24/7 emergency dispatch and typically arrive within 60-90 minutes of your call anywhere in the {{city_name}} area. For severe widespread damage events (hurricanes, major storms), we prioritize critical cases and provide estimated arrival times when you call.
```

**Q2: Will my insurance cover wind damage to my roof?**
```
Most homeowner policies cover sudden wind damage from storms. However, coverage depends on your specific policy, deductible, and the age/condition of your roof. We provide free insurance reviews and claim assistance to maximize your coverage. Common covered items include shingle blow-off, structural damage, debris impact, and related water damage.
```

**Q3: How do you protect my home if repairs can't be completed immediately?**
```
We provide emergency tarping and temporary weatherproofing within hours of arrival. This includes heavy-duty tarps properly secured to prevent further damage, board-up services for compromised openings, and water mitigation measures. These temporary protections can remain effective for weeks if needed while we coordinate permanent repairs.
```

**Q4: What if the insurance adjuster says the damage is "cosmetic" or pre-existing?**
```
This is a common tactic to minimize claims. We provide expert documentation showing the difference between wind-related functional damage and cosmetic issues. Our detailed reports, photos, and technical analysis often overturn initial denials. We've successfully challenged hundreds of lowball estimates and denial letters.
```

**Q5: Can you handle hidden wind damage that's not visible from the ground?**
```
Absolutely. Wind damage often affects underlayment, decking, and fasteners without visible surface signs. We conduct comprehensive inspections using thermal imaging, moisture meters, and detailed physical examination. Our reports identify all damage - visible and hidden - ensuring complete repairs and full insurance compensation.
```

**Q6: What wind speeds cause roof damage in {{city_name}}?**
```
Sustained winds above 50-60 mph can damage standard roofing materials. However, older roofs, improperly installed systems, or already-compromised roofs may fail at lower speeds. Hurricane-force winds (74+ mph) cause widespread damage. After any storm with 40+ mph winds, we recommend professional inspection even without visible damage.
```

**Q7: How long do permanent repairs take after wind damage?**
```
Timeline depends on damage extent and material availability. Minor repairs (shingle replacement, flashing work) typically complete in 1-2 days. Moderate damage requiring deck repair takes 3-5 days. Severe damage or full replacements may require 1-2 weeks. We provide detailed timelines after assessment and expedite all work.
```

**Q8: Do you provide warranties on wind damage repairs?**
```
Yes. All repairs include our 5-year workmanship warranty. Materials carry manufacturer warranties (typically 20-50 years depending on product). We also provide detailed documentation for your insurance records and future reference. Our repairs meet or exceed all wind resistance code requirements for {{city_name}}.
