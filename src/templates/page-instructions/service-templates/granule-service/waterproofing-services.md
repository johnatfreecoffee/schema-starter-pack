Waterproofing Questions Answered

Common questions about professional waterproofing services and solutions
```

### FAQ Items

```
Q: How long does waterproofing last?
A: Professional waterproofing systems typically last 10-20+ years depending on the materials used, application area, and environmental conditions. Premium membrane systems with proper installation often carry manufacturer warranties of 15-20 years. Regular inspections and minor maintenance can extend waterproofing lifespan significantly.

Q: What's the difference between waterproofing and water-resistant treatments?
A: Waterproofing creates an impermeable barrier that completely prevents water penetration under any conditions. Water-resistant treatments slow water intrusion but may eventually fail under pressure or extended exposure. For areas requiring absolute protection, true waterproofing systems are essential.

Q: Can waterproofing be applied to existing structures?
A: Yes, professional waterproofing can be effectively applied to existing foundations, roofs, decks, and other structures. We assess current conditions, repair any damage, and install appropriate waterproofing systems. In some cases, negative-side waterproofing (interior application) can be used when exterior access is limited.

Q: Is waterproofing only for below-grade areas?
A: No, waterproofing protects various areas including foundations, basements, crawlspaces, roofs, decks, balconies, exterior walls, planters, and any surface requiring protection from water intrusion. Each application requires specific materials and techniques appropriate to the location and conditions.

Q: How do I know if my property needs waterproofing?
A: Signs include visible water intrusion, dampness or moisture on walls/floors, musty odors, mold growth, efflorescence (white mineral deposits), cracking or spalling concrete, wood rot, or previous water damage. Even without visible issues, proactive waterproofing prevents future problems in vulnerable areas.

Q: What waterproofing systems work best in Louisiana's climate?
A: Louisiana's high humidity, heavy rainfall, and potential hurricane conditions require robust waterproofing systems. We typically recommend flexible membrane systems that accommodate building movement, UV-resistant materials for exposed applications, and breathable systems that prevent moisture trapping while blocking liquid water penetration.

Q: Does waterproofing require ongoing maintenance?
A: Professional waterproofing systems require minimal maintenance but benefit from periodic inspections. We recommend annual checks of penetrations, seams, and transitions. Most maintenance involves simple cleaning and minor sealant touch-ups. Properly maintained waterproofing can exceed its expected lifespan.

Q: Can {{business_name}} handle emergency waterproofing situations?
A: Yes, our emergency response team is available 24/7 for active water intrusion situations. We provide immediate temporary protection followed by permanent waterproofing solutions to prevent recurrence. Call {{company_phone}} for emergency waterproofing assistance.
