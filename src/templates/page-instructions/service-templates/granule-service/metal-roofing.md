**FAQ Questions & Answers**:

1. **How long does a metal roof last in Louisiana's climate?**
   "Quality metal roofs in Louisiana typically last 50-70 yearsâ€”significantly longer than traditional asphalt shingles (15-20 years). The key is professional installation and choosing marine-grade or Galvalume materials that resist Louisiana's humidity and salt air."

2. **Will a metal roof be noisy during rain or hail?**
   "No. When properly installed with solid decking and adequate insulation/underlayment, metal roofs are no louder than other roofing types during rain. Many homeowners report their metal roofs are actually quieter than their previous asphalt roofs."

3. **Do metal roofs attract lightning?**
   "This is a common myth. Metal roofs do not attract lightning any more than other roofing materials. In fact, if lightning does strike, metal roofs are safer because they're non-combustible and disperse electrical charge."

4. **How much can I save on energy bills with a metal roof?**
   "Metal roofing can reduce cooling costs by 10-25% in Louisiana's hot climate. Reflective coatings and proper ventilation help metal roofs reflect solar radiation, keeping attics and living spaces cooler. Most {{city_name}} homeowners see ROI within 10-15 years through energy savings alone."

5. **Will a metal roof increase my property value?**
   "Yes. Studies show metal roofing increases home resale value by 1-6%, and homes sell faster. The combination of curb appeal, durability, and energy efficiency makes metal roofs highly attractive to buyers in the {{city_name}} real estate market."

6. **Can you install metal roofing over existing shingles?**
   "In some cases, yesâ€”but we generally recommend removing old roofing for best results. Installing over existing shingles saves money upfront but can trap moisture and hide underlying damage. We'll assess your specific situation during inspection."

7. **What maintenance does a metal roof require?**
   "Very little. Annual inspections, keeping gutters clean, and removing debris are usually sufficient. Metal roofs don't crack, rot, or lose granules like asphalt. We recommend professional inspection every 3-5 years to maintain warranty coverage."

8. **How soon can you install my metal roof?**
   "Most {{city_name}} residential installations take 2-5 days once materials arrive. From initial consultation to completion, the typical timeline is 3-6 weeks depending on material availability and weather. Emergency repairs can often be done within 24-48 hours."
