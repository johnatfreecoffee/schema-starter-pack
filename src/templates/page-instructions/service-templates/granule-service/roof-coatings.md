| **Lifespan Extension** | 10-15 years | 20-30 years |
| **Energy Efficiency** | 10-25% improvement | Varies by material |
| **Warranty Available** | Up to 20 years | 10-50 years |
| **Environmental Impact** | Low (no tear-off) | High (landfill waste) |
| **Ideal Timing** | Preventive/early damage | Severe damage/failure |

[CALLOUT BOX]:
"For roofs in good structural condition with surface deterioration, coating provides 60-70% cost savings with comparable lifespan extension. When structural integrity is compromised, replacement is the appropriate investment."

Roof Coating Frequently Asked Questions

[Q] How long does a roof coating last?
[A] Professional roof coatings typically last 10-15 years with proper application and maintenance. Some premium silicone systems can exceed 20 years. Lifespan depends on coating type, climate conditions, roof slope, and maintenance schedule. Regular inspections and minor touch-ups can maximize longevity.

[Q] Can all roof types be coated?
[A] Most commercial and residential roof types accept coatings: metal, single-ply membranes (TPO, EPDM, PVC), modified bitumen, built-up roofs, concrete, and some asphalt shingles. Coating compatibility depends on existing roof condition, material type, and surface preparation. Our inspection determines ideal coating system for your specific roof.

[Q] Will roof coating stop existing leaks?
[A] Coating creates waterproof barrier but doesn't replace necessary repairs. We identify and repair all leaks, damaged areas, and structural issues before coating application. Once repairs are complete, coating provides seamless waterproofing that prevents future leaks from developing.

[Q] How much can I save on energy costs?
[A] Reflective roof coatings typically reduce cooling costs 10-25% by lowering roof surface temperature 50-80°F. Actual savings depend on building insulation, HVAC efficiency, climate zone, and roof exposure. Many {{city_name}} property owners see ROI within 3-5 years through energy savings alone.

[Q] What's the difference between coating and replacement?
[A] Coating restores and protects structurally sound roofs at 60-70% less cost than replacement. It's ideal for roofs with surface deterioration but good structural integrity. Replacement is necessary when substrate is compromised, extensive rot exists, or roof has reached end of serviceable life. We provide honest assessment of which approach serves your best interest.

[Q] Is special maintenance required after coating?
[A] Coated roofs require minimal maintenance: semi-annual inspections, debris removal, and periodic cleaning. We recommend professional inspection every 2-3 years to identify minor issues before they escalate. Simple maintenance schedule provided at project completion ensures warranty compliance and maximum coating lifespan.

[Q] How long does installation take?
[A] Most residential coating projects complete in 1-2 days. Commercial applications typically require 2-5 days depending on roof size and complexity. Weather conditions, necessary repairs, and coating system selected affect timeline. We work efficiently to minimize disruption while ensuring proper application and curing.

[Q] Are roof coatings environmentally friendly?
[A] Yes, coating systems offer environmental benefits: eliminate tear-off waste sent to landfills, reduce energy consumption through reflectivity, extend existing roof life (reducing manufacturing demand), and many formulations feature low VOC content. Coating is the sustainable choice for roof restoration.
