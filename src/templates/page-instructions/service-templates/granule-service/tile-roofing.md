**Section Headline (H2)**
```
Frequently Asked Questions About Tile Roofing
```
**Typography**: 36px/32px/28px, centered, margin-bottom 40px

**Accordion Items** (8-10 questions):

**Q1: How long do tile roofs last in {{city_name}}'s climate?**
```
With proper installation and maintenance, clay tile roofs can last 50-100+ years, while concrete tile typically lasts 40-50 years. This significantly exceeds the 15-20 year lifespan of asphalt shingles, making tile roofing a smart long-term investment despite higher upfront costs.
```

**Q2: Can my home structure support a tile roof?**
```
Most homes can support tile roofing, though some may require structural reinforcement. Our free assessment includes engineering evaluation to determine if your existing framing and decking can handle the additional weight. We'll provide clear recommendations and include any necessary reinforcement in our proposal.
```

**Q3: Are tile roofs good for hurricane protection?**
```
Yes, when properly installed. Modern tile roofing systems meet strict wind uplift requirements and many are rated for 150+ mph winds. The interlocking design and proper fastening methods we use have proven effective through numerous Gulf Coast hurricanes. Many insurance companies offer premium discounts for tile roofs.
```

**Q4: Do tile roofs really save energy costs?**
```
Absolutely. Tile roofing's thermal mass and ventilated installation can reduce cooling costs by 15-25% in hot climates. The air space between tiles and roof deck prevents heat transfer, and many tile profiles naturally reflect solar heat. Over the roof's lifetime, energy savings can offset a significant portion of the installation cost.
```

**Q5: What maintenance do tile roofs require?**
```
Tile roofs require minimal maintenance compared to other materials. Annual inspections, occasional broken tile replacement, and valley/flashing checks are typically all that's needed. We recommend professional inspections after major storms and enrollment in our maintenance program for optimal longevity.
```

**Q6: Can individual damaged tiles be replaced?**
```
Yes, individual tiles can be easily replaced without disturbing surrounding tiles. This is one of tile roofing's major advantages – spot repairs are straightforward and cost-effective. We maintain inventory of common tile profiles and colors for quick repairs.
```

**Q7: How do tile roof costs compare to other premium materials?**
```
Tile roofing typically costs $10-25 per square foot installed, which is higher than asphalt but comparable to metal roofing and less than slate. However, when you factor in tile's 50-100 year lifespan versus 15-20 years for asphalt, the lifetime cost is actually lower. Plus, you gain superior energy efficiency and property value enhancement.
```

**Q8: What warranty coverage comes with tile roofing?**
```
We provide comprehensive warranty protection including manufacturer material warranties (40-100 years depending on tile type), our {{business_name}} workmanship warranty (10-20 years), and transferable coverage if you sell your home. All warranties are clearly documented and registered at installation completion.
