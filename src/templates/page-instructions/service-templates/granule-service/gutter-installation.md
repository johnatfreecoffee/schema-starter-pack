## FAQ SECTION
**Component**: Accordion-style FAQ
**Background**: White
**Padding**: 80px vertical

**Section Header**:
**H2**: Gutter Installation Questions Answered
**Subheading**: Everything You Need to Know

**FAQ Accordion**: 8 questions (expandable on click)

**Q1: How long does gutter installation take?**
A: Most residential installations are completed in 1-2 days. Larger homes or complex projects may take 2-3 days. We'll provide an exact timeline during your free estimate.

**Q2: When is the best time to install gutters?**
A: Fall and spring offer ideal weather conditions, but we install year-round. {{city_name}}'s mild winters make it possible to install gutters even in cooler months, often with better availability and pricing.

**Q3: Should I install gutter guards with new gutters?**
A: Absolutely. Installing guards during initial installation saves money versus adding them later. For {{city_name}}'s heavy tree coverage, guards are essential to prevent constant maintenance and extend gutter life.

**Q4: How do I know what size gutters I need?**
A: We calculate this during your free assessment based on your roof square footage, pitch, and {{city_name}}'s rainfall data. Most homes need 5-inch or 6-inch gutters depending on water volume.

**Q5: Can gutters be installed on any type of roof?**
A: Yes. We install gutters on all roof types: asphalt shingle, metal, tile, slate, and flat roofs. Each requires specific techniques and mounting systems, which our experienced team provides.

**Q6: Will you remove my old gutters?**
A: Yes. Complete removal and disposal of existing gutters is included in our installation service. We ensure all old materials are properly removed and your property is left clean.

**Q7: Do I really need professional installation?**
A: Professional installation ensures proper pitch (critical for drainage), secure mounting, correct downspout placement, and weathertight sealing. DIY installations often fail within 1-2 years due to these technical requirements.

**Q8: What maintenance will my new gutters need?**
A: With gutter guards: minimal to none. Without guards: cleaning 2-4 times yearly. We offer annual maintenance plans to keep your system functioning perfectly with no effort on your part.
