H2: "Why Choose Green Roofs for Your [City] Property?"

Opening paragraph:
Green roofs, also called living roofs or vegetative roofs, transform ordinary rooftops into productive green spaces. In [City]'s climate, these sustainable roofing systems offer exceptional benefits—from dramatic energy savings to natural stormwater management. {{business_name}} specializes in designing and installing green roof systems that perform beautifully for decades.

### FAQ SECTION
**Component Type**: Accordion-style Q&A

**Layout**: Two-column grid (single column mobile)

**Section Header**:
```
H2: "Green Roof Questions Answered"
```

**FAQ Items** (formatted for schema markup):

**Left Column**:

```
Q: How much weight does a green roof add to my building?
A: Extensive green roofs add 10-35 pounds per square foot when saturated, comparable to traditional roofing materials. Semi-intensive systems add 35-80 lbs/sq ft, while intensive gardens can exceed 150 lbs/sq ft. Our structural engineers assess your building's capacity during the initial consultation to determine the appropriate system for your structure.

Q: Can any roof support a green roof system?
A: Most commercial buildings and many residential structures can support extensive green roofs with minimal or no structural upgrades. We perform thorough structural analysis to ensure your building can safely accommodate the system. If reinforcement is needed, we coordinate with structural engineers to make necessary modifications.

Q: How much maintenance do green roofs require?
A: Extensive systems typically need only 1-2 professional maintenance visits annually—removing debris, checking drainage, and addressing any plant issues. Semi-intensive systems require 2-4 visits yearly, while intensive rooftop gardens need monthly attention. All systems require less maintenance than traditional landscaping.

Q: What is the lifespan of a green roof?
A: Green roofs dramatically extend the life of underlying waterproofing membranes. While traditional roofs last 15-20 years, roofs protected by green systems often exceed 40-50 years. The growing medium and plants can last indefinitely with proper maintenance, though some replanting may be needed over decades.

Q: Do green roofs work in [City]'s climate?
A: Absolutely. We design green roofs specifically for [City]'s conditions—hot summers, moderate winters, and variable rainfall. Our plant selections are climate-adapted species that thrive in rooftop conditions. The systems actually perform better in warm climates due to enhanced cooling benefits.

Q: Will a green roof leak or damage my building?
A: When properly installed by certified professionals, green roofs actually protect your building better than traditional systems. We use commercial-grade waterproofing with root barriers and redundant protection layers. Our installations meet or exceed all building codes and come with comprehensive warranties.
```

**Right Column**:

```
Q: Can I access my green roof?
A: Accessibility depends on the system type and your building codes. Extensive systems are typically low-access (maintenance only), while intensive systems can include walkways, patios, and accessible garden spaces. We design access features that comply with safety regulations and your intended use.

Q: How quickly do green roofs establish?
A: Extensive systems using pre-grown sedum mats provide immediate coverage and typically establish within one growing season. Plug-planted systems take 2-3 seasons for full coverage. Intensive gardens with diverse plantings develop over 1-3 years, with trees and shrubs maturing over 5-10 years.

Q: Do green roofs require irrigation?
A: Extensive systems in [City] generally don't require permanent irrigation after establishment (1-2 years). Temporary irrigation during establishment and supplemental watering during extreme drought may be needed. Semi-intensive and intensive systems typically include automated irrigation for optimal plant health and flexibility in plant selection.

Q: What about fire safety concerns?
A: Modern green roofs are designed with fire safety in mind. We use fire-resistant growing media, maintain adequate moisture levels, and can incorporate fire breaks in larger installations. Properly maintained green roofs meet all fire codes and can actually provide fire protection to the building structure.

Q: Can I install solar panels with a green roof?
A: Yes! Green roofs and solar panels are highly compatible. The cooling effect of the green roof actually improves solar panel efficiency by 8-12%. We design integrated systems where solar panels are elevated above the vegetation, creating a complementary clean energy and sustainability solution.

Q: How do green roofs handle heavy rain or hurricanes?
A: Green roofs excel at stormwater management, absorbing 50-90% of annual rainfall. During heavy rain events, the drainage layers safely channel excess water to roof drains. The vegetation and growing medium are designed to resist wind erosion. We secure systems according to wind load requirements for [City]'s hurricane risk.
