### FAQ Items (Expandable Accordions)

**Accordion Styling**: Clean lines, expand/collapse animation, blue accent when open

#### Q1:
```
**Q: When should I start hurricane preparation in {{city_name}}?**

A: Ideally, begin preparation in April or May, well before hurricane season officially starts June 1st. This timing ensures:
- Best contractor availability
- Standard pricing (no storm premiums)
- Time for thorough work, not rushed jobs
- Ability to order custom materials
- Peace of mind throughout season

Waiting until a storm is approaching means limited availability, higher costs, and rushed work that may not be as thorough.
```

#### Q2:
```
**Q: Will my insurance cover hurricane preparation costs?**

A: Coverage varies by policy, but many insurers offer:
- Mitigation discounts for storm preparation
- Partial reimbursement for approved upgrades
- Lower deductibles for fortified homes
- Premium reductions for hurricane-resistant features

We work with insurance companies daily and can help you understand your coverage options. Some preparation costs qualify as deductible improvements.
```

#### Q3:
```
**Q: What's the difference between hurricane shutters and impact windows?**

A: Both protect against storm damage, but differ in:

**Hurricane Shutters:**
- Less expensive upfront
- Deploy only during storms
- Multiple style options
- Easier to retrofit
- Require pre-storm installation

**Impact Windows:**
- Permanent protection
- No pre-storm preparation needed
- Energy efficiency benefits
- Noise reduction
- Higher initial investment

We can assess your property and recommend the best solution for your budget and protection needs.
```

#### Q4:
```
**Q: How long does hurricane preparation take?**

A: Timeline depends on scope:

- **Inspection & Assessment:** 2-3 hours
- **Basic Preparation Package:** 1-2 days
- **Shutter Installation:** 2-5 days (depending on home size)
- **Comprehensive Fortification:** 1-2 weeks
- **Emergency Pre-Storm Prep:** 4-8 hours

We prioritize efficiency without compromising quality. Early season scheduling allows for thorough, unhurried work.
```

#### Q5:
```
**Q: What happens if a storm approaches after you've prepared my home?**

A: Our preparation includes:

1. **Immediate Support:** Priority emergency response for clients
2. **Final Checks:** Quick pre-storm verification visits
3. **Remote Guidance:** Phone support for last-minute concerns
4. **Post-Storm Assessment:** Damage evaluation after the storm
5. **Insurance Assistance:** Claims support if damage occurs

Clients in our preparation program receive priority service throughout the storm season.
```

#### Q6:
```
**Q: Can I do hurricane preparation myself?**

A: Some tasks are DIY-friendly, others require professional expertise:

**DIY Tasks:**
- Trimming nearby tree branches
- Securing outdoor furniture
- Stockpiling emergency supplies
- Cleaning gutters (single-story)

**Professional Tasks:**
- Structural reinforcement
- Shutter installation (especially upper floors)
- Roof repairs and upgrades
- Drainage system improvements
- Building code compliance work

Professional preparation ensures proper techniques, quality materials, and insurance-approved methods. Many insurance companies require professional documentation for certain upgrades.
```

#### Q7:
```
**Q: What if I'm a new homeowner and don't know my home's storm readiness?**

A: We specialize in helping new homeowners understand their property's vulnerabilities:

1. **Comprehensive Assessment:** Detailed inspection of all storm-vulnerable areas
2. **Risk Prioritization:** What needs immediate attention vs. future planning
3. **Budget Planning:** Spread improvements across multiple seasons if needed
4. **Education:** Understanding your specific home's weak points
5. **Maintenance Plan:** Long-term strategy for storm readiness

Our inspection report gives you a clear roadmap for protecting your investment, with prioritized recommendations based on risk and budget.
