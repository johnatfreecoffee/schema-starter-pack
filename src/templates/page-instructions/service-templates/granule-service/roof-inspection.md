### FAQ Content (Right Column - Scrollable)

**Category: About Inspections**

Q: How often should I have my roof inspected?
A: We recommend annual professional inspections for all roofs, with additional inspections after major storms. Roofs over 10 years old may benefit from twice-yearly checks. Regular inspections catch small problems before they become expensive repairs.

Q: What's the difference between an inspection and an estimate?
A: A roof inspection is a comprehensive assessment of your roof's condition, documenting all issues whether you repair them or not. An estimate focuses on specific known problems and provides pricing for repairs. Our inspections often include repair estimates when issues are found.

Q: Do you inspect all types of roofs?
A: Yes. Our certified inspectors are trained in residential and commercial roofing systems including asphalt shingle, metal, tile, slate, flat roofs (TPO, EPDM, modified bitumen), and specialty materials. We adjust our inspection approach based on your specific roof type.

**Category: Scheduling & Timing**

Q: How quickly can you schedule an inspection?
A: Most non-emergency inspections can be scheduled within 3-5 business days. We offer same-day emergency inspections for urgent situations like storm damage or active leaks (additional fees apply). Post-storm demand may extend wait times.

Q: How long does a roof inspection take?
A: Basic visual inspections take about 1 hour. Comprehensive inspections typically require 2-3 hours. Premium inspections with thermal imaging may take 3-4 hours. Duration depends on roof size, complexity, accessibility, and condition.

Q: What weather conditions prevent inspections?
A: We cannot safely inspect during heavy rain, high winds (>20 mph), lightning, or when roofs are icy/slippery. Light rain usually allows ground-level and drone inspection. We'll reschedule at no charge if weather prevents thorough assessment.

Q: Do I need to be home during the inspection?
A: Not necessarily for exterior-only inspections, but we recommend it. If attic or interior access is needed, someone must be home. Being present allows you to ask questions and receive immediate verbal findings.

**Category: What to Expect**

Q: Will inspectors walk on my roof?
A: When safely accessible, yes. Our inspectors follow strict safety protocols and use appropriate equipment. For steep, fragile, or dangerous roofs, we use drone technology and ground-level assessment tools to avoid damage or injury risk.

Q: Will the inspection damage my roof?
A: No. Our trained professionals know proper walking patterns and techniques to prevent damage. We avoid stepping on ridge caps, valleys, and fragile materials. If your roof is too fragile for foot traffic, we'll note that in our report and use alternative inspection methods.

Q: What should I do to prepare for an inspection?
A: Ensure inspector access to property, clear driveway for parking, secure pets, provide attic access if needed, locate any previous inspection or repair records, and note any specific concerns you want addressed.

Q: Can you inspect while repairs are being done?
A: We recommend inspecting before work begins to document pre-existing conditions, or after completion to verify quality. Mid-project inspections are possible but may require multiple visits for complete assessment.

**Category: Reports & Results**

Q: When will I receive my inspection report?
A: Basic reports: same day (verbal) with written report within 24 hours. Comprehensive reports: 24-48 hours. Premium reports with thermal imaging: 48-72 hours. Rush delivery available for additional fee.

Q: What's included in the inspection report?
A: Comprehensive reports include: executive summary, overall condition rating, detailed findings with photos, priority-rated recommendations, repair cost estimates, maintenance schedule, material lifespan projections, and code compliance notes.

Q: How long is the inspection report valid?
A: Inspection reports reflect conditions on inspection date. We consider them valid for 6-12 months for general purposes, but storm events or new damage can change conditions quickly. Pre-purchase reports should be as recent as possible.

Q: Can I share the report with insurance or contractors?
A: Absolutely. Reports are provided in easily shareable digital format (PDF). Many customers share with insurance adjusters for claims, contractors for repair quotes, or real estate agents for property transactions. You own the report and can distribute as needed.

**Category: Costs & Payment**

Q: Why do inspection costs vary?
A: Pricing depends on roof size, complexity, accessibility, inspection type (basic vs. comprehensive), add-on services (thermal imaging), and urgency (same-day premium). We provide exact quotes before scheduling.

Q: Do you offer free inspections?
A: We offer free inspections when combined with insurance claim assistance or for properties where we'll perform the repair work. Standard inspections for information-only purposes have the fees listed in our pricing section.

Q: Is the inspection fee credited if I hire you for repairs?
A: Yes! If you choose {{business_name}} for recommended repairs over $XXX, we credit your full inspection fee toward the project cost. This applies to work scheduled within 90 days of inspection.

Q: What payment methods do you accept?
A: We accept all major credit cards, debit cards, checks, and cash. Payment is due upon report delivery. For premium inspections, we offer financing options through our in-house financing program.

**Category: After the Inspection**

Q: What if you find serious problems?
A: We'll explain findings clearly, prioritize issues by urgency, and provide immediate temporary solutions if needed. For emergencies like active leaks, we can often provide same-day tarping or temporary repairs while you decide on permanent solutions.

Q: Am I obligated to use {{business_name}} for repairs?
A: No obligation whatsoever. You're free to use our report to get quotes from any contractor. Many customers appreciate getting multiple bids. We're confident our competitive pricing and quality will earn your business if you choose to work with us.

Q: What if I disagree with the inspection findings?
A: We welcome questions and provide photo evidence for all findings. If you have concerns, we'll review specific items and consider second opinions from engineering consultants when appropriate. Our goal is accurate assessment, not unnecessary work.

Q: Will you provide a roof certification letter?
A: Yes. For qualifying roofs in good condition, we can provide certification letters for insurance, mortgages, or real estate transactions (additional fee). Certification includes condition confirmation, estimated lifespan, and any conditions or limitations.
