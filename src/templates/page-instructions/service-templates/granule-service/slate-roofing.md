- Question: 18px bold, #2D3748
- Answer: 16px regular, #4A5568
- Expandable: Click to reveal answer
- Border bottom: 1px #E2E8F0

**FAQ 1:**
Q: How long does a slate roof last?
A: When properly installed and maintained, natural slate roofing can last 75-150+ years. Many historic slate roofs exceed 100 years of service. The longevity depends on slate quality, installation expertise, and regular maintenance. Premium slate varieties and excellent installation can achieve 150+ year lifespans.

**FAQ 2:**
Q: Can my existing roof structure support slate?
A: Slate is significantly heavier than conventional roofing (800-1,500 lbs per square vs. 200-250 lbs for asphalt). A professional structural assessment is essential before slate installation. Many homes require reinforcement of rafters and decking. {{business_name}}'s engineers evaluate your structure and recommend any necessary upgrades to safely support slate.

**FAQ 3:**
Q: What is the cost of slate roofing in {{city_name}}?
A: Slate roofing typically costs $1,200-$2,500+ per square installed, depending on slate variety, roof complexity, structural requirements, and project scope. While this represents a significant initial investment, the 100+ year lifespan makes slate one of the most cost-effective roofing choices over time. We offer financing options and detailed cost breakdowns.

**FAQ 4:**
Q: Can individual slate tiles be replaced if damaged?
A: Yes, individual slate tiles can be carefully removed and replaced by experienced slate roofers. This is one of slate roofing's major advantages—localized damage doesn't require complete roof replacement. {{business_name}}'s specialists use proper techniques and matching slate to seamlessly repair damaged areas without disrupting surrounding tiles.

**FAQ 5:**
Q: Does slate roofing require special maintenance?
A: Slate requires minimal maintenance compared to other roofing materials. Annual professional inspections, gutter cleaning, and prompt repair of any damaged tiles are the primary maintenance needs. Proper flashing inspection and occasional replacement of worn fasteners ensure optimal performance. We offer comprehensive maintenance programs for slate roofs.

**FAQ 6:**
Q: What colors and styles of slate are available?
A: Natural slate is available in gray, black, green, purple, red, and mottled varieties. Colors range from uniform to variegated patterns. Unfading varieties maintain their color indefinitely, while weathering slates develop beautiful patina over time. We offer standard architectural slate and premium designer collections from quarries worldwide.

**FAQ 7:**
Q: Is slate roofing environmentally friendly?
A: Slate is one of the most environmentally sustainable roofing materials. It's 100% natural stone requiring no manufacturing, contains no chemicals, and is fully recyclable. The century-plus lifespan means no replacement materials for generations, significantly reducing environmental impact compared to roofs requiring replacement every 15-25 years.

**FAQ 8:**
Q: How does slate perform in storms and high winds?
A: When properly installed with correct headlap and secure fastening, slate roofing performs exceptionally well in severe weather. Slate is inherently wind-resistant and has a Class A fire rating. The material's density and weight provide superior wind uplift resistance. Copper flashing systems prevent water intrusion even in hurricane-force conditions.
