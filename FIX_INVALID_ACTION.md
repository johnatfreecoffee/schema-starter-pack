# Fix: Handle Invalid Action in Edge Function

## Problem Summary

The edge function failed when trying to generate a homepage with these errors:

### 1. **Gemini API Overload (Primary Issue)**
- Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro API returned `503 - The model is overloaded`
- Multi-stage pipeline failed after 3 retry attempts
- Single-shot fallback also returned 0 bytes of HTML
- Total generation time: 144 seconds (critically slow)

### 2. **Validation Mismatch (Bug)**
- **Validator expected:** `<main>` tags
- **System prompt told AI to generate:** `<div id="ai-section-...">`
- Even if AI generated correctly, validation would reject it

### 3. **Poor Error Messages**
- Frontend showed generic "Failed to fetch"
- No user-friendly feedback about API overload
- Empty responses not detected early

---

## What Was Fixed

### Fix #1: Update HTML Validation
**File:** `supabase/functions/ai-edit-page/index.ts` (lines 19-27)

**Before:**
```typescript
// Only accepted <main> tags
if (!/^<main[\s>]/i.test(trimmed)) {
  errors.push('Output must start with <main> and be content-only HTML');
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Now accepts BOTH formats
const validStarts = /^<(div\s+id="ai-section-|main[\s>])/i;
if (!validStarts.test(trimmed)) {
  errors.push('Output must start with <div id="ai-section-..."> or <main> (content-only HTML)');
}
```

---

### Fix #2: Detect Empty API Responses Early
**File:** `supabase/functions/ai-edit-page/index.ts` (lines 744-748, 2252-2256)

**Added checks in two places:**

**In pipeline stage execution:**
```typescript
// Check if we got empty content from pipeline stage
if (!content || content.trim().length === 0) {
  console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è Stage ${stage.name} returned empty content`);
  throw new Error(`Stage ${stage.name} failed: API returned empty response. The model may be overloaded.`);
}
```

**In single-shot streaming:**
```typescript
// Check if we got empty HTML from streaming
if (!updatedHtml || updatedHtml.trim().length === 0) {
  console.error('‚ùå AI returned empty HTML');
  throw new Error('AI generation failed: No content generated. The API may be overloaded. Please try again in a few minutes.');
}
```

---

### Fix #3: Better Error Messages for API Overload
**File:** `supabase/functions/ai-edit-page/index.ts` (lines 732-735, 2390-2401)

**In pipeline stage:**
```typescript
if (response.status === 503) {
  throw new Error(`Stage ${stage.name} failed: API overloaded (503). Please wait a few minutes and try again. Google's Gemini API is experiencing high traffic.`);
}
```

**In main error handler:**
```typescript
let userMessage = error.message || 'Unknown error occurred';

if (error.message?.includes('overloaded') || error.message?.includes('503')) {
  statusCode = 503; // Service unavailable
  userMessage = 'üîÑ Google\'s AI service is temporarily overloaded. Please wait 2-3 minutes and try again. This is not an error with your request.';
} else if (error.message?.includes('empty') || error.message?.includes('No content generated')) {
  statusCode = 502; // Bad gateway
  userMessage = 'AI generated no content. The API may be overloaded. Please try again in a few minutes.';
}

return new Response(JSON.stringify({
  error: userMessage, // User-friendly message
  errorType: error.constructor.name,
  originalError: error.message, // Technical details for debugging
  metrics: { duration, timeoutOccurred }
}), {
  status: statusCode, // Proper HTTP status
  headers: corsHeaders
});
```

## Error Messages Users Will See Now

### Before:
```
‚ùå Error Occurred
Unable to reach the server. Please check your connection and try again.
TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

### After (API Overload):
```
üîÑ Google's AI service is temporarily overloaded.
Please wait 2-3 minutes and try again.
This is not an error with your request.
```

### After (Empty Response):
```
AI generated no content. The API may be overloaded.
Please try again in a few minutes.
```

### After (Timeout):
```
Request timed out. The AI took too long to generate content.
Please try a simpler request or try again later.
```

## Why This Happened

### Root Causes:

1. **Google's Gemini API was experiencing high traffic** (503 errors)
   - This is outside our control
   - Happens during peak usage times
   - Solution: Wait a few minutes and retry

2. **Validation logic didn't match system prompt**
   - System prompt told AI to generate `<div id="ai-section-...">`
   - Validator only accepted `<main>` tags
   - Fixed by accepting both formats

3. **Empty responses weren't caught early**
   - API returned 0 bytes but code continued processing
   - Led to confusing "Failed to fetch" errors
   - Now detected immediately with clear messages

---

## Testing Results

### What Changed:
- ‚úÖ Validation now accepts both `<main>` and `<div id="ai-section-...">` formats
- ‚úÖ Empty responses detected immediately
- ‚úÖ User-friendly error messages for API overload
- ‚úÖ Proper HTTP status codes (503, 502, 504)

### What Didn't Change:
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to API
- ‚úÖ Same functionality when API works
- ‚úÖ All quick wins from previous commit still active

---

## What to Do If This Happens Again

### For API Overload Errors (503):
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** - Let Google's servers recover
2. **Try again** - Usually works on second attempt
3. **Try during off-peak hours** - Less traffic = more reliable

### For Empty Response Errors:
1. **Check if prompt is too long** - Try shorter request
2. **Wait a few minutes** - API may be recovering
3. **Check logs** - Look for 503/504 errors

### For Timeout Errors (144+ seconds):
1. **Simplify the request** - Less content = faster generation
2. **Use fewer sections** - Reduce complexity
3. **Try single-shot instead of multi-stage** - Disable pipeline if needed

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/ai-edit-page/index.ts` (+37 lines, -7 lines)

**Changes:**
1. Updated `validateHTML()` function (lines 19-27)
2. Added empty content check in pipeline stage (lines 744-748)
3. Added 503 error handling in pipeline (lines 732-735)
4. Added empty HTML check after streaming (lines 2252-2256)
5. Updated error status codes and messages (lines 2390-2415)

## Summary for Lovable Agent

**What broke:** Gemini API was overloaded (503 errors), returned empty responses. Frontend showed generic "Failed to fetch" error.

**What we fixed:**
1. Made validation accept both HTML formats (`<main>` and `<div>`)
2. Detect empty responses early with clear messages
3. Show user-friendly errors for API overload
4. Return proper HTTP status codes (503, 502, 504)

**What users see now:** Clear messages like "Google's AI service is temporarily overloaded. Please wait 2-3 minutes and try again."

**No breaking changes** - Same API, just better error handling.
